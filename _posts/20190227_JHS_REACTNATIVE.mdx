## Prerequisites

Before going any further, I am expecting that you atleast have a basic understanding about Next.js and MDX before hand.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com)

    console.log(`${movie}, ${year}`);
```


```jsx
    const year = "2001";
    const movie = "Shrek";
